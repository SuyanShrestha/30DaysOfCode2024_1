Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my twenty-eighth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I learnt some more linux commands. Today, i covered up commands lying on five more sections, and their different options, and then made a detailed documentation on those commands with usable screenshots and examples. The sections i covered were :
- filter
- linux networking
- users
- system admin command
- linux file security

THe list of commands in each section is tabulated below.

Practice Code is present at my github :
