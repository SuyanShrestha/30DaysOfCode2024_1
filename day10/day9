#Day10ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my tenth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Currently I am learning React native. Today I learnt about following topics:
- ScrollView
- FlatList and how it differs from map function for rendering lists
- useState and useEffect hooks


Summary:
ScrollView in React Native provides a way to display a large amount of content that exceeds the screen size vertically, enabling smooth scrolling for users to access all the content seamlessly. FlatList, unlike the map function, is specifically designed for rendering large lists efficiently in React Native by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen, which improves performance and reduces memory usage. useState and useEffect are two essential hooks in React Native for managing state and side effects respectively. useState allows you to add state variables to functional components, enabling them to update and rerender based on changes to those variables, while useEffect enables you to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data from APIs or subscribing to events, and it runs after every render.
