#Day24ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my twenty-fourth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I just did some comfort learning and dived a bit into MYSQL. I learnt about following stuff today:
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY
- JOINS (inner, left, right, full outer, self)
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- ALTER

Practice Code is present at my github :
