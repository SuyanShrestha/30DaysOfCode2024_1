#Day18ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my eighteenth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I just implemented this search functionality in my app. Furthermore, so that there wont be too many api fetches for every letter search, I also implemented principles of debouncing in this.

Practice Code is present at my github :
