#Day11ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my eleventh day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Currently I am learning React native. Today I learnt about following topics:
- SectionList
- StatusBar
- Pressables
- Fetching API data, showing it with different approaches and advantages of those approaches.


Summary:
The 'SectionList' component facilitates organized data display by categorizing content into sections, streamlining navigation and comprehension. The 'StatusBar' module enables fine-grained control over the device's status bar appearance, ensuring consistent visual feedback across applications. 'Pressables' offer versatile touch handling capabilities, supporting various gestures and interactions to enhance usability.
