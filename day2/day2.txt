#Day2ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my second day. I encourage everyone to begin their 100 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com 

Today, I started building frontend for my new project 'khaniGoals'. It is kinda like an ecommerce website targeted for food delivery services. Today, I made the Navbar section, Hero Section and a functionality for button clicks on Menu section.

Practice Code is present at my github :
