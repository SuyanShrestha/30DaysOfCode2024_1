Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and today is my thirtieth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program, here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I explored Version Control Systems (VCS), learning about the differences between Distributed (DVCS) and Centralized (CVCS) systems. I also set up SSH for secure communication and practiced basic Git commands like git init, git clone, git add, git commit, and git push. Excited to streamline my workflow!

Practice code is present at my GitHub:
