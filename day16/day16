Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my sixteenth day.

Today, I learnt about authentication basics using Firebase.

Summary:
Firebase Authentication provides a robust and secure way to manage user authentication for web and mobile applications. It supports multiple authentication methods, including email and password, phone authentication, and federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. With Firebase Authentication, developers can easily integrate user sign-in and sign-up functionalities, manage user sessions, and secure user data. The service also offers advanced features like password recovery, email verification, and multi-factor authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
