#Day15ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my fifteenth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I just glanced upon some basics of MongoDB. Here's what I learnt today:
- embed vs reference
- $rename operator
- $set and $unset operator
- $lookup operator

I will paste my notes in my github.

Practice Code is present at my github :
