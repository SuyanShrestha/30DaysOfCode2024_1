Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my seventeenth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I just made this simpple authentication functionality in my Swaadsansaar app, through Firebase. I will probably work on redesigning the UI of these login, signup, signout and dialog box components, along with using custom dialog boxes to show messages instead of alert popups tomorrow.

Summary:
The SignUp component in this code allows a user to create a new account. It uses React's useState hook to manage local state for the username, email, password, loading status, and confirmation password. When the signUp function is called, it first checks if all fields are filled and if the password matches the confirmation password. If all checks pass, it sets the loading state to true and attempts to create a new user with the provided email and password using Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword function. If the user is successfully created, it updates the user's profile with the provided username. The AccountInfoDialog component, although not shown in this excerpt, would typically be used to display the user's account information after they've successfully signed up or signed in.

Practice Code is present at my github :
